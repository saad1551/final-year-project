            The latest observation from the web browsing environment.

        restrict_viewport: Tuple[float, float, float, float]
            A tuple of the form (x, y, width, height) that restricts the

        require_visible: bool
            Boolean indicating whether the observation should only include
            elements that are current in a visible state.

        require_frontmost: bool
            Boolean indicating whether the observation should only include
            elements that are currently in the frontmost layer.

            Boolean indicating whether the observation should remove any

        observation: PlaywrightObservation
            An updated observation with a `processed_text` field that contains
            an agent-readable version of the observation.
